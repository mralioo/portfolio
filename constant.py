    "Intro": "A Machine Learning Engineer",
    "About": "🚀 From zapping circuits with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from the University of Stuttgart to mastering the art of AI at TU Berlin, my journey's been electric. I first wielded my code and charm in the realm of automotive sorcery at IAV GmbH, then ventured into the bustling world of logistics with Trumetrics, where I played with algorithms instead of trucks. \n\n 🧠 My Master's saga? How did it unfold, you ask? It's peppered with brainy projects, like crafting a toolbox for neuroscience ninjas.\n\n 🤖 As a self-proclaimed MLOps Chef, I whip up automated ML pipelines that serve up AI solutions as if they were fast food - quick, efficient, and downright delicious. Lately, I've been flirting with Large Language Models like GPT-4, dreaming up chatbots that could outwit your average toaster. \n\n 🎯 My mission? To keep surfing the AI wave, updating my wizardry toolkit, and turning sci-fi into reality. \n\n 🛠️ When I'm not conjuring AI spells, you'll find me in the garage, building drones that could win races in the Matrix, or robocars that think they're in Fast & Furious. And when it's time to unplug, I hit the trails, jogging and hiking🏃🌲, because even wizards need to recharge in nature. Let's make magic happen together! ✨",
