    Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) represent a significant
    paradigm within the field of neurotechnology, particularly for individuals with
    paralysis. By mentally rehearsing motor movements, MI-BCIs facilitate control
    over prosthetic limbs or wheelchairs. The construction of a classifier for MI-BCI applications involves complex processing and feature extraction from brain signals
    to distinguish between various mental states. BCI is inherently multidisciplinary,
    demanding expertise not only in neuroscience, machine learning, and electrical
    engineering but also in software development. The complexity of integrating
    these disciplines necessitates a comprehensive toolbox that encompasses standard
    methods and is regularly updated with new datasets and algorithms. Such a toolbox enables scientists and engineers to rapidly prototype and develop algorithms
    efficiently. Given the increasing prominence of deep learning in numerous fields,
    this thesis introduces a deep learning interface incorporated into an existing BCI
    toolbox. This interface streamlines the development and training of neural networks, adhering to a more automated and standardized machine learning lifecycle.
    Utilizing the Sensorimotor Rhythm (SMR) dataset, the largest open BCI dataset
    available, this thesis integrates it into the BBCPy toolbox as a standard resource.
    The dataset is employed as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of deep
    learning models in the Motor imagery BCI classification task.

This track challenged participants to create innovative solutions for the automotive sector, focusing on enhancing the driver's experience through personalized welcomes, virtual vehicle applications, controlling off-road vehicles, and more.

    After 30 hours of intense collaboration and creativity, we introduced **Optiway**, a revolutionary LLM companion integrated into electric vehicles (EVs). Optiway is not just a navigation tool; it's a smart assistant that understands personal preferences, such as the desire for a specific type of restaurant. It then finds the optimal restaurant that not only matches the user's taste but also has the closest charging station, ensuring convenience and efficiency for EV owners.

    Our solution represents a step forward in making EV ownership more seamless and personalized, addressing common concerns about charging infrastructure and range anxiety.

    This project aims to control a double inverted pendulum using model predictive control (MPC). The starting position is set to the origin of coordinates with both pendulums hanging down. The MPC approach shall be able to, within physical limitations, bring cart and pendulums in any arbitrary position while avoiding given obstacles.

    The model of a double pendulum can be used in real-life applications, for example in the field of robotics. Furthermore, it is useful in understanding fundamental principles of pendulum behavior, which itself is a widely used model for a variety of systems.

    For the problem at hand, we will use a direct MPC approach utilizing orthogonal collocation. An essential part of the problem is finding a suitable cost function.

    In addition, a reinforcement learning approach is used, namely soft actor critic (SAC). The results of both methods will be compared.

    ‚ÄîNowadays Reinforcement Learning (RL) shows promising advancement in fields like image recognition tasks by not relying on closed form solutions and finding solutions by applying e.g. inference techniques. Therefore, an agent tries out different actions on a given environment to find a nearly optimal solution. These approaches are used to solve more and more control problems. They are already used in the communication and networking domain. To evaluate transmission schemes/network stacks an environment to train an agent is necessary. Additionally, researchers are using GNU-Radio as Software Defined Radio (SDR) tool to do rapid and low-cost prototyping for new and existing wireless technologies. In this paper, we introduce gnugym, a framework to use GNU-Radio as OpenAI Gym environment. Thereby, we enable RL for GNU-Radio. gnugym includes a general part, caring about communication and management of GNU-Radio. Via two interfaces, a specific environment is loaded describing the specific Machine Learning (ML) model. This split allows rapid integration of new ML models within the framework. As proof of concept, we use an implementation of the IEEE 802.11p stack and run it in a loopback example. The Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) is set for given Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) values. During training, the distance between sender and receiver varies. With some Supervised Learning (SL) algorithms, there is successful training.
