### EEG
EEG, a non-invasive imaging technique, records bioelectrical potentials on the scalp. It dates back to Hans Berger's pioneering work in 1929. EEG measures electrical fields generated by the movement of ions along axons, leading to momentary polarization of neurons. The signals detected are macroscopic oscillations resulting from synchronous nerve firing. EEG employs a cap of electrodes mounted on the scalp, with different types such as dry and wet electrodes.

### Signal Acquisition
Recorded EEG signals typically have low amplitudes, ranging from 50-100 microvolts. The potentials originate from the cerebral cortex, primarily pyramidal cells' dendrites. EEG signals suffer from poor spatial resolution due to cortical folds and grooves, resulting in paradoxical lateralization and the conduction volume effect. During data acquisition, steps such as noise removal, signal amplification, and quantization are applied.
